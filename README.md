# Instagram followers scraper

This tool uses Python and [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) to scrape the list of followers and people following a user and see the difference with a previously recorded list.

## Requirements

You need to have Python 3 and PIP installed. You can follow [these installation instructions](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/starting/install/osx/). You also need to have Chrome installed as Selenium uses the `chromedriver` contained in the `drivers` folder.

Finally, you'll need your Instagram credentials to log in. At this time the dialog with the list of followers cannot be opened as an anonymous user.


## Installation

Download this project manually or clone the repo with git:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:frabonomi/instagram-followers-scraper.git
```

Then go to the directory and install the required dependencies

```bash
cd instagram-followers-scraper
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installing the dependencies run the `main.py` file with Python 3:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

You'll be asked to input the username that you want to analyze and your Instagram credentials. You can get info about followers, following or both. The data will be stored in the `exports` folder. 

You can also write your config with all your options inside `config.txt` and do
```bash
cat config.txt | python main.py
```

## TODO

- Speed up scraping of the users. Right now scraping is quite slow and can be improved
- Handle wrong credentials or missing username
